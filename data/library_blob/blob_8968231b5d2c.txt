# Claude Code Configuration

## Interaction Model
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous—don't assume intent.
- Recap plan before executing. Wait for approval on major changes or large file additions.
- On errors: stop, explain what failed and why, present ranked fix options (recommended first). Don't auto-fix.
- Never commit, push, or modify git history. I handle version control.
- No test generation unless explicitly requested.

## Confirmation Boundaries
**Execute without asking:**
- File reads, directory traversal, grep/search
- Non-destructive bash (ls, cat, find, etc.)
- Installing dependencies when clearly needed

**Confirm before:**
- File writes, deletions, moves
- External API calls or network requests
- Running code with side effects
- Modifying config files
- Anything outside working directory

## Code Style
**Python:** Type hints always. Dataclasses over dicts for structured data. Poetry for venvs. No classes unless necessary—prefer functions.

**React/TypeScript:** Functional components, hooks, strict mode, named exports.

**C++:** C++17+. RAII. Smart pointers. No raw new/delete unless C interop.

**General:** 
- Readability over cleverness. No premature abstraction.
- Match existing project conventions when present.
- Inline comments or per-method, low verbosity.
- Opinionated on best practices for new code only—don't suggest refactors unless asked.

## Editing Behavior
- Surgical edits over full rewrites.
- Write directly to codebase—avoid showing code in chat unless needed for discussion.
- Check existing project structure/conventions before starting.
- Focus on immediate task. No proactive architectural improvements outside current scope.

## Decision-Making
- Present reasoning and 1-2 alternatives for ambiguous decisions.
- Never make architectural decisions without my input.
- For large additions: get approval on structure before creating files.

## Context
Senior CompE at Purdue, software focus. Systems/architecture level. Direct, no fluff.
