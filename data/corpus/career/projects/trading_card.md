# TradingCard Platform

**Period:** September - October 2025, Development Paused  
**Type:** Full-Stack Learning Project  
**Repository:** [tharpep/tradingcard_project](https://github.com/tharpep/tradingcard_project)  
**Topics:** Docker, FastAPI, Full-Stack, PostgreSQL, Python, React, TypeScript

## Technical Stack

**Backend:**
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with multi-user schema
- **Architecture:** Clean separation with `/backend` directory structure
- **API Design:** RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes
- **Authentication:** User authentication and authorization system
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization

**Frontend:**
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Architecture:** Modern web application with `/frontend` directory
- **Integration:** Clean API consumption from backend

**Development:**
- **Documentation:** Detailed `PLAN.md` and `QUICKSTART.md` for project planning
- **Structure:** Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- **Testing:** Test framework setup

## Technical Implementation

**Backend Architecture:**
- Modular structure with `/api`, `/database`, `/models`, `/repositories`, `/services`
- Configuration management system
- CLI tools for development and setup
- Database migrations and schema management
- Service layer for business logic

**Database Design:**
- Multi-user database schema with proper isolation
- User authentication tables
- Trading card collection data model
- Foreign key relationships and constraints

**API Features:**
- RESTful endpoints for card management
- User authentication endpoints
- Proper error handling and validation
- Request/response models with Pydantic

## Learning Objectives

Successfully achieved the primary goal: learned to build a complete schema/database project with:

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented secure user management system
- **Multi-User Data Isolation:** Database schema ensuring user data separation
- **Clean API Design Patterns:** RESTful API following best practices
- **Frontend-Backend Integration:** React frontend consuming FastAPI backend
- **Project Planning & Documentation:** Created detailed planning documents (`PLAN.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`)
- **Docker Deployment:** Containerized application for easy deployment
- **TypeScript Integration:** Type-safe frontend development

## Project Structure

The project demonstrates understanding of:
- Full-stack architecture patterns
- Database design and multi-tenancy
- API design and documentation
- Modern frontend development
- Containerization and deployment

## Current Status

Development intentionally paused after achieving learning objectives. The project served its purpose as a hands-on learning experience in full-stack development fundamentals. The codebase remains available as a reference for future projects.
