# Team 35 Senior Design - Cognitive Coach

**Period:** August - December 2025  
**Type:** 4-Person Team Capstone Project  
**Course:** Senior Design Capstone (Purdue University)

## Project Overview

AI-powered cognitive coaching system with integrated hardware and software components. The system provides real-time cognitive coaching through multiple interfaces including mobile app, web dashboard, and smart glasses hardware.

## Your Role & Contributions

**Position:** One of the lead contributors and organizers (second to Anjali)

**Technical Responsibilities:**

**GenAI Subsystem Development (`/gen-ai` directory):**
- **Language:** Python-based AI/ML pipeline implementation
- **Core Functionality:** 
  - Integration with coaching algorithms
  - Real-time processing capabilities
  - Machine learning model integration
  - Natural language processing for coaching interactions
- **System Integration:** Connected GenAI components with mobile, webapp, and glasses subsystems
- **Architecture Design:** Contributed to overall system architecture decisions and cross-subsystem communication protocols

**Leadership & Coordination:**
- Organized team efforts and coordinated between subsystems
- Ensured successful integration of GenAI components with broader system
- Contributed to system architecture and design decisions
- Managed technical dependencies between subsystems

## System Architecture

The project consists of four major subsystems:

1. **GenAI (Python)** - Your primary area
   - AI/ML pipeline for cognitive coaching
   - Real-time processing and response generation
   - Integration with coaching algorithms

2. **Mobile** - Mobile application interface
   - User interaction and coaching delivery
   - Real-time data synchronization

3. **Webapp** - Web-based dashboard
   - Analytics and monitoring
   - User management and configuration

4. **Glasses** - Hardware integration component
   - Wearable device interface
   - Sensor data collection

## Technical Challenges

- **Real-time Processing:** Implementing low-latency AI responses for coaching interactions
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** Ensuring seamless communication between Python backend, mobile app, web dashboard, and hardware
- **System Architecture:** Designing scalable architecture supporting multiple interfaces
- **Team Coordination:** Managing technical dependencies across four subsystems with multiple developers

## Team Dynamics

As a lead contributor, you were instrumental in:
- Organizing team efforts and setting technical direction
- Coordinating between subsystems to ensure successful integration
- Contributing to system architecture decisions
- Ensuring GenAI components integrated smoothly with mobile, web, and hardware subsystems

**Status:** Completed capstone project - successfully delivered integrated system with all four subsystems working together
