# ECE461 Part 2 - Package Registry

**Period:** August - December 2025  
**Type:** Team Course Project (Purdue University)  
**Course:** ECE461 - Software Engineering

## Your Specific Contributions

### 1. Rating Metrics Development (TypeScript)

Implemented three critical package quality metrics that evaluate different aspects of package reliability and maintainability:

- **Reproducibility Metric:** Measures build/test reliability and consistency across different environments
  - Validates that packages can be built and tested reliably
  - Checks for deterministic build processes
  - Evaluates test coverage and reliability

- **Reviewedness Metric:** Analyzes code review coverage and quality
  - Measures percentage of code reviewed
  - Evaluates review quality and thoroughness
  - Tracks review patterns and coverage

- **TreeScore Metric:** Evaluates dependency tree health and structure
  - Analyzes dependency relationships
  - Identifies potential security vulnerabilities
  - Evaluates dependency tree complexity and maintainability

**Implementation Details:**
- TypeScript implementation for type safety
- Integration with package registry API
- Automated metric calculation and scoring
- Results stored and displayed in registry interface

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Setup

**Cloud Architecture:**
- Architected and deployed cloud infrastructure for scalable package registry
- Configured multiple AWS services for production deployment
- Designed for scalability and reliability

**Infrastructure-as-Code:**
- Implemented infrastructure-as-code practices for reproducible deployments
- Version-controlled infrastructure configuration
- Automated provisioning and configuration

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines
- Automated testing and deployment workflows
- Integration with version control for automated releases

**AWS Services Used:**
- Multiple AWS services configured for registry functionality
- Scalable architecture supporting package storage and retrieval
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Technical Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (for metrics development)
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS (multiple services)
- **Focus Areas:** 
  - Package management systems
