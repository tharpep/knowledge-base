# Mermaid Architecture

- **architecture-overview.md** — High-level diagram: inputs, service boundaries, and external dependencies. Use for quick orientation.
- **architecture-detailed.md** — Detailed diagram: entry, routes, RAG pipeline (sync, loader, embedder, retriever), and database schema. Use for implementation and onboarding.

Render the `mermaid` code blocks in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (e.g. GitHub, VS Code with extension, or [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live)).
